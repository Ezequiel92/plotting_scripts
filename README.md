# Plotting scripts

Scripts to produce figures for a series of GADGET3 simulations. 

All make use of [GADGETPlotting.jl](https://github.com/Ezequiel92/GADGETPlotting). 

## Folders

The figures, GIF and videos generated will be saved in ../results/analysis_XXX/ (the folder will be created if it doesn't exist) where XXX is the number of the script. The snapshots are expected to be located in ../../sim_data/run_00/, ../../sim_data/run_A_01/, etc. So, the expected file structure is:

    .
    ├── sim_data
    │    ├── run_00
    │    ├── run_A_01
    │    └── ...
    ├── results 
    │    ├── analysis_001
    │    │    ├── ...
    │    │    └── ...
    │    ├── analysis_002
    │    │    ├── ...
    │    │    └── ...
    │    └── ...
    └── code
         ├── GADGETPlotting 
         │    ├── src 
         │    │    ├── GADGETPlotting.jl   
         │    │    └── ...  
         │    └── ...
         └── plotting_scripts
              ├── analysis_001.jl
              ├── analysis_002.jl
              └── ...
         

## Documentation

A comment at the beginning of each script explains which figures are produced.

## Warning

These scripts are written for data generated by GADGET3 (which is not a publicly available code) and require snapshot files which are too heavy for a GITHUB repository. The intension of the repo is to be a backup for the scripts, and to facilitate reproducibility.
