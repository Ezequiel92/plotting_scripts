# Plotting scripts

Scripts to produce analysis in the form of figures for certain GADGET3 simulations. 

- All make use of [GADGETPlotting.jl](https://github.com/Ezequiel92/GADGETPlotting).
- The figures, GIF and videos generated will be saved saved in ..\results\analysis_XXX\ (he folder will be created if it doesn't exist) where XXX is the number of the script. 
- The snapshots are expected to be located in ../../sim_data/run_00/, ../../sim_data/run_A_01/, etc. So, the expected file structure is:

    .
    ├── sim_data
    |   ├── run_00/
    |   ├── run_A_01/
    |   └── ...
    └── code
        ├── GADGETPlotting 
        |   ├──GADGETPlotting.jl
        |   └── ...
        ├── plotting_scripts
        |   ├── analysis_001.jl
        |   ├── analysis_002.jl
        |   └── ...
        └── results 
            ├── analysis_001
            |   └── ...
            ├── analysis_002
            |   └── ...
            └── ...

## Documentation

A comment at the beginning of each script explains its objective.

## Warning

These scripts are written for data generated by GADGET3, which is not a publicly available code, and require snapshot files which are to heavy for a GITHUB repository. The intension of the repo is to be a backup for the scripts, and to facilitate reproducibility.
